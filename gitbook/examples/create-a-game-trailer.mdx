## Generate Images

You'll create 4 base images first, then animate them. Each gets 4 variations - pick your favorite.

### Scene 1: Underground Metro

Copy this prompt:

```json
{
  "prompt": "Photorealistic third-person shooter perspective from the POV of a soldier descending into a futuristic metro station. The squad leader moves ahead down wet steps into a dim corridor filled with flickering red lights, steam, and debris. The foreground shows the following soldier's rifle partially raised. Subtle reflections on flooded rails, scattered trash, sparks in the distance. HUD: lower-left mini-map, top-right health and ammo, faint crosshair in center. Same camera angle, same gear, cinematic neon-blue and orange palette with consistent lighting and tension.",
  "negative_prompt": "bad anatomy, unreadable HUD, low detail, weird lighting, distorted perspective",
  "seed": 87
}
```

### Scene 2: City Street

<video controls src="https://files.gitbook.com/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FkZmAMkk6kBVPNceQRurL%2Fuploads%2FMh0nBupQmYlSCOuQf1lV%2Ffourth_frame_docs.mp4?alt=media&token=1065c1b5-034b-4525-9787-d75c0f1311b8" />

```json
{
  "prompt": "Photorealistic third-person shooter screenshot showing two soldiers advancing through a rain-soaked futuristic city street at night. The camera is positioned from the POV of the second soldier, with their rifle partially visible in the lower foreground. Ahead, a matte-black armored soldier (the squad leader) walks through neon reflections, flaming wrecks, and swarming alien drones overhead. Explosions light up the wet street and Chinese neon signs. HUD overlays: bottom-left mini-map, top-right ammo and health, subtle crosshair. Cinematic rain, motion blur, high-fidelity lighting, blue-orange contrast.",
  "negative_prompt": "text overlays, watermarks, broken anatomy, missing limbs, distorted weapons, cartoon artifacts",
  "seed": 87
}
```

### Scene 3: Stairwell

```json
{
  "prompt": "Photorealistic third-person shooter camera angle from the POV of a soldier ascending a dark, narrow stairwell. The main soldier climbs slowly ahead with a flashlight beam cutting through the dust. Part of the rifle and gloves of the following soldier are visible in the lower frame. The stairwell is grimy concrete, with red emergency lights flickering and wet steps reflecting the flashlights. HUD overlays: mini-map, ammo, and subtle mission objective. Shadows flicker with muzzle movement. Matches same urban combat style, lighting, and equipment from city street scene.",
  "negative_prompt": "cartoon effects, broken walls, disfigured limbs, poor shadow detail, low realism",
  "seed": 87
}
```

### Scene 4: Rooftop

```json
{
  "prompt": "Photorealistic third-person shooter view from the POV of a soldier standing on a high rooftop, partially showing their weapon in the lower frame. Ahead, the squad leader in matte-black tactical armor stands at the edge of the rooftop, looking out over a futuristic war-torn city in flames. Neon-lit towers rise into smoke-filled skies; alien drones swarm above, and explosions light distant streets. Rain falls steadily. HUD shows mini-map lower left, crosshair centered, ammo and status top-right. Same dark, cinematic vibe as city chaos shot, with consistent character and lighting.",
  "negative_prompt": "distorted arms, broken gear, low resolution, text glitches, incorrect lighting",
  "seed": 87
}
```

## Animate Everything

Now switch to the animation model and bring your images to life.

<video controls src="https://files.gitbook.com/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FkZmAMkk6kBVPNceQRurL%2Fuploads%2Ff93AHTDtFRZeNHObcfTF%2Ffifth_frame_docs.mp4?alt=media&token=8e88115d-8a4f-42ea-87a6-83fde130eecd" />

### Switch Models

Switch to **SEEDANCE-1-PRO** (same method as before).

### Animate Each Scene

**Scene 1 - Underground:**

```json
{
  "prompt": "Dimly lit underground metro tunnel. Third-person POV behind soldier, following another down wet stairs into a flickering corridor. Water on tracks reflects red lights. Steam bursts from vents, sparks fall from ceiling. Camera dips slightly on each step. Same soldier armor and gear. Subtle flashlight beam moves. Realistic ambient effects.",
  "duration_seconds": 10,
  "seed": 87,
  "audio": "Dripping water, footstep echoes, flickering light buzz, distant subway screech, radio ping"
}
```
